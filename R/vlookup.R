# to dos in function -------------------------------------------------

# function should take a data frame and a vector

# within the data frame, two colums are selected, one that is the indicator and one that is the return value

## TESTTHAT
# - order is correct when units return.

# match could also be character, this must work as well, need to be checked
# add also an quiet = TRUE element, that suppresses warnings.
# add then onexit argument, that resets the options
# see here the slides

## add checks

#' vlookup
#'
#' This function is an implementation of the vlookp function from Excel. It is used to return values from a column in a data frame, which correspond to certain values in another column in the same data frame. These other values are taken as input for the function.
#'
#' @param data A data frame in which the values should be looked up
#' @param look.for The values to look for in the column \code{look.in} in the data frame.
#' @param look.in The column to which the values from \code{look.for} are matched.
#' @param return.from The column from which the corresponding values are returned.
#' @param return.multiple If one value from \code{look.for} would return multiple values from \code{return.from}, should these multiple values be returned? Default is to FALSE.If set to FALSE and multiple matches occur, an error is returned.
#' @param return.na Should missing values be returned? Defaul is to TRUE.
#'
#' @return A vector with the corresponding values from the column \code{return.from}. Length must not be the same as \code{look.for}, but usually is if \code{return.multiple = FALSE} and \code{return.na = TRUE} and all values from \code{look.for} are in \code{look.in}.

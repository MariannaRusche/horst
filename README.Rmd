# horst-package
This is a collection of functions used be and some of my colleagues in [Pschological Diagnostics](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/personal/91680294) at Humboldt-University of Berlin.
Up to now, there are only very few functions and most of them are tailored to a specific problem, relying on input from specific functions from other packages (see respective help-pages).

It is also my first package, thus not highly sophisitcated.

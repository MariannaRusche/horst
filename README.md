=============

This is a collection of functions used be and some of my colleagues in [Pschological Diagnostics](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/personal/91680294) at Humboldt-University of Berlin.

Up to now, there are only very few functions and most of them are tailored to a specific problem, relying on input from specific functions from other packages (see respective help-pages).

\begin{description}
\item[omegaW] A function to compute Omega's W.
\item[simpsonCor] A plot that allows discovering the Simpsons Paradox.
\item[getTable] A function that produces a correlation table in Excel which is close enough to an APA correlation table for further editing.
\item[matchItems] Based on the \code{psych} package, this function adds items from a codebook to the result of an efa.
\item[plotMod] Plots an interaction on three dimensions, one being coloured dots.
\item[renameCodebook] Using a codebook (for example from excel), function changes names in a data set according to the codebook. 
\end{description}
